The purpose of this project is to put everything I have learned about HTML, the command line, and git to the test. I utilized inserting links, images, ordered lists, and unordered lists. As well as creating a multi-page html document that can be opened on the web. I found this project to be fairly simple. Git and GitHub basics are still a little confusing to me, but I am determined to figure it out before moving onto CSS. Overall, this was a fun project that made me feel great about making a "website" that I could navigate!
