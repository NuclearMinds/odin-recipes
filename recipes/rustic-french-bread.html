    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>I found this recipe one day while scrolling through TikTok. It seemed simple enough so I decided to try it out the next time we made a pasta dish
        for dinner. This bread is incredibly fast to make and is the perfect side for any soup or sauce-based meal. As an added bonus, we usually spead 
        some butter and garlic on the top when it is fresh out of the oven. Enjoy!

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 cup of warm water</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups of bread flour</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in a bowl and knead for five minutes. Knead in the bowl for easy cleanup.</li>
        <li>Lightly cover with olive oil, cover bowl, and let rise for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once risen, roll dough into a long oval shape that is about two hands long. Fold 1/3 of the long side into the middle. Cover the fold with the 
            other 1/3. Pinch any seems together. Shape the ends to form a loaf.</li>
        <li>Make three slashes in the top of the loaf and brush with ice water.</li>
        <li>Place in a cold oven and turn heat to 400. Bake for 27 minutes.</li>
