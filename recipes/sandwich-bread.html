    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>This bread is adapted from a recipe from King Arthur Baking Company. Their recipe can be found 
        <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-sandwich-bread-recipe">here</a>. The bread is the perfect bread for a 
        grilled cheese or some toast at breakfast. For a more dense loaf, bake in a cold 350 degree oven. Enjoy!</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>3 cups of all-purpose bread</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of milk (1%, 2%, or whole)</li>
        <li>1/2 to 2/3 cup of hor water</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of melted butter or 1/4 cup of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 packet of active dry yeast or 2 teaspoons of instant yeast</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Combine milk and hot water in a small bowl to make a luke warm mixture. Combine mixture with all other ingredients in a large mixing bowl. 
            Mix until a dough ball forms and does not stick to the bowl. Knead dough for 6 minutes on a greased surface or in a mixer.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and let dough rise for 1 to 2 hours until it has risen to just under half the original size.</li>
        <li>Gently deflate and form into a loaf on a greased surface. Place loaf in a 8" loaf pan and cover with plastic wrap. Let continue rising for 60 
            minutes. Towards the end of the rise, preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until it is light golden brown. Internal temperature of the loaf should be 190 degrees.</li>
        <li>Let cool on rack before slicing. Store in a plastic bag at room temperature for several days.</li>
